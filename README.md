#Development
Build it with Visual Studio 6.0, and test it, try to look at some features you want, and add something in opengl32.cpp.

Should be able to compile with Visual Studio 2015.

#How to install?
Make sure your CS1.6 version is 4554 or below!

Copy opengl32.dll and it's belonging config file to CS1.6 main directory.

#Caution
This probably not VAC safe, so you may want to test it with bots, or non-steam server.

**Use at your own risk.**

#Author
I'm not, but it is discontinued, so I edit it.
